# CryptocurrencyPortfolio

This is a GUI based portfolio app which manage the data about the coins(cryptocurrencies), in which have invested.
In this project we deal with Json data comes from "CoinMarketCap API". This API gives real time data about various Cryptocurrencies.
I use this Json data to find real time profit and loss on various coins. I use tkinter for GUI and python for handling Json data and Backend coding.
